				<h2>Infotainment Design Challenge</h2>
				<h3>Successful application for UI/UX position in Vehicle Infotainment team</h3>
				<h4>(Part of University of Washington team for EcoCAR3, a 4-year national competition to convert a Chevrolet Camaro into an advanced hybrid electric vehicle)</h4>

				<button class="projectTitle">Design a Feature</button>
				<div class="project">
					<p>Goal: design a feature to include in a vehicle infotainment.</p>
					<p>I designed the Predictive Refueling System (PRS), a system that seamlessly and intuitively anticipates and fulfills a user's fuel needs by leveraging data from the car, cloud, and user.</p>
					<div class="carousel clearfix">
						<button class="previous">&lt;</button>
						<div class="slide">
							<img src="Images/Portfolio/ecoCar/feature/I1.png">
							<p>Although sketches refer to gas vehicles,  similar concept applies to electric vehicles. <br><br>In general, I imagine the UI of the infotainment system to be highly voice-based (with advanced voice recognition as the primary mechanism of communication between driver and car). Voice is ideal as it reduces distraction to driver. However, displays offer visualization of information, useful for maps. For the purposes of this application, I sketched out what the visual displays might look like.  </p>
						</div>
						<div class="slide">
							<img src="Images/Portfolio/ecoCar/feature/I2.png">
							<p>Predictive Refueling System (PRS) lets user know how long until they run out of gas based on current and recent rate of fuel consumption, current and future traffic conditions, road conditions, closures.<br><br>If they are en route somewhere, user clicks on “Is my destination reachable?” to determine if they have enough gas to reach where they’re trying to get to.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="slide">
							<img src="Images/Portfolio/ecoCar/feature/I3.png">
							<p>PRS displays at what point the user will run out of gas, relative to their destination. If unable to reach destination with the amount of fuel available, user clicks on “Find gas stations en route.”</p>
						</div>
						<div class="slide">
							<img src="Images/Portfolio/ecoCar/feature/I4.png">
							<p>PRS shows user what gas stations are on the way to their destination, including the last station at which the user will be able to refill before running out of gas. <br><br>User can filter results based on the price of fuel, distance to station, amount of traffic on the way, and/or past stations where they’ve bought gas. For instance, if they tend to buy gas at Shell stations, they can filter results to prioritize Shell stations. <br><br>User clicks on one of the suggested gas stations to get more info.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="slide">
							<img src="Images/Portfolio/ecoCar/feature/I5.png">
							<p>PRS displays relevant info about the selected gas station, including how far away it is (in distance and time), whether or not it is open, and price per gallon.<br><br>User clicks on “Get me there” to get directions to selected gas station, or “Show more options” to get back to the previous slide.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="slide">
							<img src="Images/Portfolio/ecoCar/feature/I6.png">
							<p></p>
						</div>
						<div class="slide">
							<img src="Images/Portfolio/ecoCar/feature/I7.png">
							<p>PRS alerts the user that they are low on gas and specified how many miles are left. User clicks on “Find nearby gas stations” to find places where they can refuel within range of current gas level.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="slide">
							<img src="Images/Portfolio/ecoCar/feature/I8.png">
							<p>If the user is not en route to a particular destination, PRS suggests the nearest gas station which the user can reach based on how much gas they have left in their tank. User clicks on “Get me there” to get directions to the selected station.<br><br>If the user doesn’t like the suggested option, they click on “Show more options.”</p>
						</div>
						<div class="slide">
							<img src="Images/Portfolio/ecoCar/feature/I9.png">
							<p>If the user is heading to a particular destination, PRS suggests a station that is on the way so that they aren’t taken out of their way.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="slide">
							<img src="Images/Portfolio/ecoCar/feature/I10.png">
							<p>If there are no gas stations within reach of the amount of fuel left, PRS indicates this. User clicks on “Call AAA” and PRS sends an automatic distress message to AAA, along with user’s name, vehicle information, location and membership number.</p>

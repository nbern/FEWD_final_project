				<h2>What do I do in my day job?</h2>
				<p>I coordinate research studies at the Seattle Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center. My current project is a qualitative study evaluating a web-based treatment for women Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  My twin passions for understanding people and helping them led me to this career path, where I found much fulfillment in supporting individuals with mental and emotional problems. I am very excited that this same path is now leading me in a new direction: user-centered research and design.</p>
				<h2>What drives me?</h2>
				<p>I am fascinated by the potential for user-centered methods to bring psychology and technology together. Both user-centered research and psychology are founded upon understanding people and their experiences, which I've greatly enjoyed in my work at the VA. For example, in my current project I conducted interviews with women Veterans about our web-based treatment, brainstormed user-centered modifications based on our findings, and worked with developers to iterate on the website in anticipation of an upcoming second round of user interviews.</p>

				<h2>Why user-centrism?</h2> 
				<p>In my eyes, user-centrism is a philosophy that offers massive opportunities to help us achieve our full potential. I seek to embrace it both professionally and personally, by challenging and opening myself up to new experiences and viewpoints. I am a deeply curious person, forever asking "Why?" and pondering the implications.</p>
				<h2>Where am I going next?</h2>
				<p>As part of my journey into the user-centered field, I am incredibly excited to be joining the University of Washington's Human-Center Design and Engineering program this fall! As a student in the Master's program, I will continue to fuel my passsion for combining psychology and technology in order to empower people more effectively and enable them to reach goals!</p>

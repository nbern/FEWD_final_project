			<h4>Challenges to Enrollment and Participation in Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Among Veterans: A Qualitative Study. Martinez, M.E., Kearney, D.J., Simpson, T.S., Felleman, B.I., Bernardi, N.E., and Sayre, G.. <span>The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine.</span> July 2015, 21(7): 409-421. doi:10.1089/acm.2014.0324. </h4> 
			<h5>This research study focused on understanding the barriers that veterans faced in enrolling and participating in the VA-based mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program. The research team conducted semi-structured interviews with veterans who had participated in the MBSR program. The interviews were then coded and analyzed for themes. The results of the findings led to the creation of a veteran-specific MBSR teacher resource, as well as modifications to the participant workbook. The study was carried out by the Research & Development department of the VA Puget Sound Healthcare System.</h5>
